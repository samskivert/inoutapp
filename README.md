# Input/Output

A simple mobile app for tracking of things you want to put into your head: books to read, games to
play, movies to watch, etc. The web version also supports a daily journal, which is not yet
implemented in this mobile version. TODO!

## Building

It builds and runs like a normal [Flutter] app:

```
flutter run
```

Then you can install it to a device (assuming you have jumped through all the necessary setup
hoops), like so:

```
flutter install --release
```

## Using

Right now I haven't published this app to any app stores. So you have to build and install it to
your own device. It will then connect to the same backend used by the webapp, which is here:
