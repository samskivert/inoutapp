# Input/Output

A simple mobile-friendly webapp for tracking of things you want to put into your head: books to
read, games to play, movies to watch, etc. The web version also supports a daily journal, which is
not yet implemented in this mobile version. TODO!

## Building

It builds and runs like a normal [Flutter] app:

```
flutter run
```

Then you can install it to a device (assuming you have jumped through all the necessary setup
hoops), like so:

```
flutter install --release
```

## Using

If you just want to use the app, you can use the instance I operate at:
